##### IMPORTANT: This is the new repository for our project. We switched to the Laravel Framework since with the NodeJS framework we had to do a lot of nested callbacks (see http://callbackhell.com/).

2) Change Xampp's MySQL password to isY2metT by following [this tutorial](https://www.roodex.com/blog/change-password-phpmyadmin-mysql-xampp/).
3) Clone the Repository into htdocs with the folder named as laravel instead of ConUShop.
